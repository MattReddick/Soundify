Soundify is a cross platform application between Soundcloud and Spotify on Android so that people 
can queue up music from both platforms without having to alternate between both. 



# UI Design
### Player Page (Home)
Design is supposed to resemble that of a typical music player application. The page includes: Album Art, Artist Name, Song name, Progress Bar, Play Button, PlayNext Button, PlayPrevious Button, Shuffle, and Repeat Song Button. On this page, users have the functionality associated with the listed buttons and UI mention in the previous sentence.


### Search Page
Design is supposed to resemble that of a typical search page. The search bar is at the top. We decided to use to listviews to display song results. One listview is for Spotify songs and the second is for Soundcloud Firebase songs. On this page, users are able to search for songs and add songs to the queue.  


### Queue Page
Design is supposed to resemble that of a typical queue page on music player application. On this page, users have the ability to delete songs and shuffle the order of the queue around. 

# Code Structure

We ultimately decided to use 3 main fragments to draw out the different pages of our app. The MainActivity contains the navigation view that displays the fragments. We also implemented a Song class that represents a song and a Player class that handles the playing of music and queueing of songs. 

### Song Class
This class contains the relevant information that a song should have.

- Song Title (String)
- Artist (String)
- Album Name (String)
- Audio URL (String)
- Image URL (String)
- isSpotify (Boolean)
- Duration (Int)
- ID (Int)

The isSpotify variable allows us to see if a song in the queue came from the Spotify or if it came from the Firebase Library.

### Player Class

Contains functions and variable that handle playing the music.

#### Variables:

- Current Song (Song)
- Queue (List of Songs)
- Progress Bar
- Album Art (ImageView)
- SpotifyPlayer
- FirebasePlayer (MediaPlayer)

#### Functions:

- Play/Pause()
- PlayNext()
- PlayPrevious()
- Shuffle()
- Loop()
- Spotify SDK/Firebase functions
  - Handle Data Retrieving

Since Spotify uses an SDK to play its music and Firebase uses the android studio native MediaPlayer class, we had to create two different ways to play music and figure out a way to smoothly transition between the Spotify SDK and MediaPlayer.

To play the music from all fragments continuously we had to make it global. The most global class in the application is MainActivity. It is continuously running in the background since it is the class that is displaying the fragments. So we decided to create the player object from the MainActivity, that way it will also run continuously in the background. If changes need to be made to the player, each fragment is able to access the player by accessing MainActivity. 

# Data
### Spotify

We use authentication tokens to communicate with Spotify's servers. When searching for a song in Spotify's library, we make an HTTP request and we recieve a JSON formatted text that contains information about songs that are related to our search. Ex. If we make and HTTP request using the string "Justin Beiber" the JSON will contain the top 10 results relating to Justin Beiber. Once we parse the song data, we can use the Spotify SDK to play the song.

### Firebase

Due to issues with Soundcloudâ€™s API not being public, we had to create our own Music Library so we decided to do that using Firebase. In Firebase, we stored several songs which each stored the basic values of a Song Class. The links that each song has are connected to files that are saved within the Firebase storage. MediaPlayer has the option of playing songs using URLs, so when we feed MediaPlayer the URL, it fetches it from the Firebase storage.
